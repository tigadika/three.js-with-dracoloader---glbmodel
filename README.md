## Integrating Blender model to three.js using DRACOLoader and GLTFLoader

**work in progress**

This is a repository of me learning to use three js from scratch. From building a 3d model in blender, then export it as GLTF model, and import it in three js file. In this repo, I also learned to code with a Singleton OOP design pattern.
